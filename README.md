# Longest-Common-Subsequence
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (here just two sequences).  The input of this problem is to sequence A and B with length n and m respectively and the goal is to find a common subsequence with maximum length.  The problem is solved by Dynamic Programming (DP) approach and the time complexity of the algorithm is O(mn).  You can find the implementation of the algorithm in Python here.
